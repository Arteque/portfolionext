> As a **web tamer**, I tame browsers with precise code, patience, and discipline.

In the coding phase, I implement designs with accuracy â€“ using both modern frameworks like **React** and CMS solutions like **TYPO3** and **WordPress**.

I focus on **modular**, **maintainable** code that is optimized for **performance**, **accessibility**, and **responsiveness**.

Additionally, I handle the **maintenance** and regular **updates** of websites.
