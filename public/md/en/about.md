Hello,  
I am a **front end web developer**.

For over **4 years**, I built numerous modern, high-performance, and user-friendly websites.  
I bring not only technical expertise but also a clear focus on the essentials, along with a structured and reliable working method.

I am used to working autonomously, meeting deadlines, and successfully completing the projects I am involved in, whether as part of a team or individually.

I have had the opportunity to participate in all phases of numerous projects, from initial meetings with clients to the delivery and maintenance of the final product. I also contributed to training various team members.

### What defines My work ethic?

- **Determined:** I work solution-oriented and focused on results.
- **Attention to Detail:** Clean, maintainable code and a keen eye for detail are essential to me.
- **Communicative:** I value clear and friendly communication, whether with clients, partners, or colleagues.
- **Adaptability:** With the experience gained from working with diverse teams and environments, I can easily adapt to new tools, technologies, and workflows while maintaining high performance.


I am fluent in **German**, **French**, **English**, and **Arabic**. This helps me understand and implement projects across different linguistic and cultural contexts.

I work focused, meticulously, and in close collaboration with my clients. Good communication is particularly important to me to ensure that the final product meets the clients expectations and provides a real added value.
