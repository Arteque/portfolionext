**P'tit Pont** is a kindergarten website that I designed, developed, and integrated into **WordPress**.

It presents the P'tit Pont preschool in Kenitra, Morocco, and highlights its playful and participatory educational approach for children aged from 1 to 6. The site provides informations about events, enrollment, and the schoolâ€™s educational philosophy.

### Technical Implementation

I designed this website using **Adobe XD**, **Illustrator**, and **Photoshop**. For the frontend, I used **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, while **PHP** and **WordPress functions** were used to integrate it as a custom theme.
