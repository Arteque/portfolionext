**Photosnap** is a **sharing platform** for **photographers** and **storytellers**.

### Tech Stack

My role was to **develop** and **publish** the website online!  
For this, I chose **Vite**, **React**, **React Router**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
As with all my websites, I followed a **Mobile-First** approach with full **responsiveness**.  
The **component-based structure** makes it easy to **implement** or **modify** new **features**, which simplifies the **scalability** of the site.
