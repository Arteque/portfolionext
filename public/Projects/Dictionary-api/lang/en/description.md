- **Error Handling**: Clear feedback is shown for invalid or unknown words.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for all screen sizes â€“ from smartphones to desktops.
- **Font Switching**: Users can choose between different font styles.
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Interface supports toggling between dark and light modes.
