**Space Tourism** is a multi-page web app I built as part of the *Frontend Mentor Challenge*. The goal was to create a modern and immersive user experience centered around **space tourism**, almost like you’re about to board your own space trip.

### 🛠️ How it's built
The site is entirely built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The design and requirements came straight from the challenge brief, but I added my personal touch during the implementation.  
My main focus was creating a **responsive layout** that looks great across all devices – whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone. I also made sure to structure the code clearly to ensure maintainability and scalability.
